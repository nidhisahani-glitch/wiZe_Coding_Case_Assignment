STEPS TO RUN THE SCRAPER :

1. Execute the scrape function from the provided code to start scraping dat from the dataset.
2. The scraped data will be saved.
3. Run the TF-IDF vectorization and Naive Bayes model training code to classify topics.
Optionally, use LDA for unsupervised topic discovery.
4. Evaluate the model accuracy and review the classification report for model performance details.

DEPENDDENCIES AND REQUIRED LIBRARIES : :

1. requests and beautifulsoup4: For web scraping and parsing HTML content.
2. pandas: For data handling and storage in CSV format.
3. scikit-learn: For TF-IDF vectorization, Naive Bayes classification, LDA, and evaluation.
4. textblob: For sentiment analysis.
5. wordcloud and matplotlib: For generating visual representations of topics.
6. seaborn: For visualizing model performance.

RETRAIN THE MODEL :

1. Load my updated or newly collected data.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Run TF-IDF vectorization on the training data, followed by model training using MultinomialNB or another classifier of your choice.
4. Save the retrained model if needed for later use.

TOPIC CLASSIFICATION :

1. Naive Bayes Classification: Modify the y labels (e.g., by assigning different topics).
2. Keyword-Based Rules: Add or adjust keywords associated with each topic and implement rule-based matching (if using a custom keyword-based classification approach).
3. LDA Topic Discovery: Adjust the number of topics (n_components) in the LDA model as needed to explore various topic structures.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS :

1. Model Simplicity: The Naive Bayes model is effective for text classification but may not capture nuanced topics as well as more advanced models like BERT.
2. Unsupervised Topics with LDA: LDA topics may require interpretation and fine-tuning to yield coherent topics.
3. Scraping Limitations: Adhere to ethical scraping practices (rate-limiting, respecting robots.txt files), as some sites may block your IP if requests are too frequent.
